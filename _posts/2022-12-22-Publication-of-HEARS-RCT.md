Congratulations to the entire HEARS team on having [HEARS RCT published in JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2799655). It is incredibly gratifying to see the  result of a long-term collaboration, and even more gratifying knowing that it will improve the accessibility of hearing care. It has been an incredible experience to work on this project from the pilot study to the confirmatory trial. HEARS embodies the best of statistical collaboration: an interdisciplinary team working together to address an impactful problem using sound methods and best practices.
